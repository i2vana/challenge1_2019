Raster Data Configurations
==============================

- Preamble (workshop/document intro etc.)
-- [[[]]]

- Short introduction to raster data (vs vector)
-- theory
-- storage
-- common uses
-- etc. [[[]]]

- Setting the Stage (short example)
-- Overview of the image types
-- Possible use cases
-- Load images in to GeoServer
-- Practical differences when viewing
-- Rationale for the differences
-- How can we optimize?

- Working with Raster Tiles and Pyramids
-- Background / Context
-- PRE-sampling vs RE-sampling
-- Tiling and/or Pyramiding
-- Internal vs External storage

- Raster Tiles and Pyramids in GeoServer
-- Strategies
-- Tile sizes
-- Pyramid levels
-- Format implications
-- TIFF - One format to rule them all!
-- Compression
-- Lossy vs Lossless
-- BigTIFF
-- Resampling Algorithm
-- Native CRS
-- Illustrations (at least) examples (maybe) would rock here [[[]]]

- RGB vs Paletted Images
-- Background
-- Colour depth choice
-- Example / Demo [[[]]]

- Preparing a Single Raster File
-- Background
-- Data Context
-- Tiling with GDAL_TRANSLATE
-- Pyramiding with GDALADDO
-- [[[]]] Investigate the results with demo/walkthrough...
-- Merging tiles with GDAL_MERGE
-- [[[]]] Can we see it?

- Using a Tiled Mosaic (ImageMosaic Store)
-- Background / Rationale
-- Creating from a single file
-- Re-Tiling Multiple files
-- Loading into GeoServer
-- Add pyramids to many external tiles
-- Examples examples examples [[[]]]

- Using Pyramids
-- [[[]]] I don't get how this slots in to the rest of the workshop?

- Fine-Tuning GeoServer Image Mosaic and Pyramid Stores
-- Background / Rationale
-- ImageMosaic Tuning
--- Allow Multi-Threading
--- USE_JAI_IMAGEREAD
--- Through GeoServer UI
--- Extended configurations through .properties
--- Examples / Before & Afters [[[]]]

- Storing Raster Tiles in a Database
-- [[[]]] Risky? Out of scope? Omit?

- Global Settings for Raster Data
-- Background / Context
-- Native JAI/ImageIO
-- Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) Settings
-- Coverage Access Settings
-- Reprojection Settings
-- Demo results and enhancements [[[]]]

Flotsam

[[[]]] Add to intro that some of this happens in ~ three places:
--- data
--- strategy
--- geoserver

[[[]]] Images/examples throughout 
[[[]]] Would help illustrate some of the concepts in the theory heavy sections
