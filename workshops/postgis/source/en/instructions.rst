Learning Outcomes
=================

#. Get familiar with the web user interface that PGAdmin 4 offers to perform SQL operations on a PostgreSQL database and install the PostGIS extension.
#. Learn PostGIS geometry types, geography, spatial reference identifiers (SRID), and projections.
#. Use the spatial extension PostGIS to move spatial data in and out of a PostgreSQL database, taking advantage of the QGIS DB Manager and GDAL/OGR commands to handle raster and vector layers.
#. Understand and use spatial indexing.
#. Perform spatial calculations with vector data stored as PotGIS geometries or geography.
#. Use spatial operations to validate and simplify geometries.
#. Perform GIS analysis by using spatial joins.
#. Explore raster data information and perform simple analysis by combining geometries with rasters.
#. Perform nearest-neighbour search (NNS).
#. Use PGRouting for basic routing algorithms in a graph structure stored in a PostgreSQL+PostGIS database.
#. Connect QGIS and a PostgreSQL+PostGIS database to visualize and process spatial data.

Prerequisite Knowledge
----------------------

For this training a basic understanding of relational database technology (tables, indexing, and the SQL language) is required. The course contains some explanations of spatial data formats and types, but a knowledge of spatial theory and some prior experience with spatial data would enhance the learning. Basic knowledge of the use of a GIS (e.g. QGIS) is desired for handling, visualizing, and styling vector and rasters layers.

Educational Approach
--------------------

The proposed training will be based on a hands-on approach that encourages the reader to follow each exercise step by step at his/her pace. The material will be provided with practices starting with an introduction to a real life scenario using datasets from current sources.
Each practice will contain screenshots that accompany each step of the exercises to minimize the risk of lack of completion by the trainee due to misinterpretation. In addition, the course will be assisted through a collaborative platform where trainees can exchange their experiences, issues, and successes in relation to every practice.
