# UNOSGEO challenge 2019

This is the repository for the material for training of PostGIS for the United Nations by the UNOSGEO Challenge 2019.

The material ready to use is under postgis-workshop-2020 in the form of HTML website of as a PDF document.

In order to build the website, run the script with the following command: `perl build_script/build_html_common_git.pl`

The directories set in the script should be updated to the path in your computer before running the command. The site will be created in htdocs, navigate through it by opening index.html with your favourite browser.

For pdf output, the script will output the latex source which can then be zipped and uploaded to overleaf to obtain the document.
